# Laplace Operator on Grafs

This repository was created years ago to practice with my code skills. I wanted to work with with the Laplace Operator for graphs to analyze them from a spectral approach. This repository 
it's not very useful, if you are interested in the Laplace operator you can see [this](https://github.com/mcbosch/graph-neural-network-for-directed-graph-classification) repository
where we work with the magnetic Laplacian; a generalization for directed graphs.
